            <p>Peanut butter is ground up nuts, and peanuts are dug out of the ground - hence the name. I first obtained this recipe from a professional hunter I met years ago. </p>

                <h3>Allondigas Meatball</h3>
                <p>Allondigas are small meatballs. They become a festive snack or appetizer when served on Mestemacher rounds with a pepper cream sauce.</p>

                <h3>Grilled loaf</h3>
                <p>If you are looking for an excuse to start that grill, look no further. Buttermilk makes for the perfect chicken coating, yielding tender meat every time.

                <h3>Kibbi Soup</h3>
                <p>It is very often served as a main course. A particular favourite amongst kids, it's easy to make and always greatly appreciated.</p>
